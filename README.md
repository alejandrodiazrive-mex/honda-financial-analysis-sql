## 🚀 Executive Summary
**The Problem:** Identifying "Revenue Leakage" in a B2B service platform (Honda Dealership) where 35% of the user base lacked valid contact data, preventing re-engagement.
**The Solution:** I built a SQL-based simulation to treat operational logs as SaaS activity data, modeling Churn Risk and Infrastructure Efficiency.
**The Impact:** Modeled a **$79,830 USD** annual revenue recovery opportunity (Realistic Scenario) by implementing a "Win-Back" strategy for high-LTV accounts.
 
## 🚀 Strategic Impact & Skills

**Target Roles:** Data Analyst | Junior Analytics Engineer | RevOps Analyst | SaaS Operations

**Core Competencies Demonstrated:**
* **Business-First SQL:** Window Functions (`RANK()`), CTEs, and conditional logic used for **Production-oriented analysis**.
* **SaaS Metrics Modeling:** Translation of operational logs into **MRR simulations**, **Churn Proxies**, and **ARPU**.
* **Financial Strategy:** Scenario modeling and **Pareto Analysis** to drive leadership decision-making.

## 🔄 The "Translator" Layer (The Business Logic)
I translated physical service events into digital subscription concepts to demonstrate business acumen.

| Operational Concept | SaaS Equivalent | Business Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Missing Phone Number** | **Incomplete User Profile** | Prevents re-engagement & increases Churn Risk. |
| **Service Appointment** | **Active User Session** | Measuring DAU/MAU (Engagement). |
| **Advisor Name** | **Customer Success Manager (CSM)** | Evaluating Account Manager performance. |
| **Morning vs. Afternoon Shift** | **Server Load / Cloud Capacity** | Optimizing AWS/Azure fixed costs during idle times. |
| **Car Models (CR-V, HR-V)** | **Subscription Tiers** | Identifying High-LTV segments for upsell. |

## 📂 Repository Structure & Analysis Pipeline

This project follows a strict ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) logic, separating data cleaning from financial analysis.

| File | Type | Business Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `00_schema_prep.sql` & `01_data_quality_audit.sql` | **ETL & Validation** | Normalizes data and filters "impossible" entries (negative hours) to ensure a single source of truth. |
| `02_revenue_leakage.sql` | **Revenue** | Quantifies the "Cost of Bad Data". Calculates total money left on the table due to "Ghost Users". |
| `03_operational_capacity.sql`| **Ops / Cost** | Identifies 40% idle capacity in afternoon shifts—equivalent to "Dead Rent" in cloud infrastructure. |
| `04_product_mix.sql` | **Pareto Strategy** | Uses RANK() to identify the top 2 "Star Tiers" driving 80% of volume. |
| `05_retention_strategy.sql` | **Actionable Churn Logic** |Segments users inactive for >180 days. (180 days chosen to avoid seasonal false positives). |
| `06_scenario_modeling.sql` | **Financial Projections** | Uses conservative ARPU ($120) to compare recovery outcomes. |
| `07_saas_metrics.sql` | **Simulation** | **North Star Metrics**: Calculates Inactivity Rates (Churn Proxy) and Revenue Exposure per Tier. |

## ⚖️ Strategic Assumptions & Trade-offs
This analysis favors explainable, conservative assumptions over aggressive forecasting:

**Churn Proxy (180 days)**: Selected to minimize false positives caused by seasonal service patterns. Shorter windows improve recall but reduce actionability.

**ARPU ($120 USD)**: Used as a stable reference point to compare orders of magnitude between scenarios, not as a rigid forecast.

**Scope**: Focuses on revenue recovery and utilization efficiency; acquisition costs (CAC) are intentionally out of scope for this simulation.

## 💰 Key Findings & Financial Scenarios

Instead of assuming a "total loss", this analysis models recovery scenarios using a $120 USD ARPU (Conservative Estimate). Note: The goal isn't exact precision, but to compare orders of magnitude between scenarios.

### 📉 Scenario Analysis (Recovery Potential)
| Scenario | Recovery Rate | Estimated Revenue Impact | Strategy Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pessimistic** | 5% | **$26,310** | Passive Email Automation |
| **Realistic** | **15%** | **$78,930** | SMS + Dedicated CSM Outreach |
| **Optimistic** | 30% | **$157,860** | Full Account Management Intervention |

## 🧭 Stakeholder Impact (How to use this)
RevOps / Finance: Prioritize win-back campaigns based on expected ROI.

Customer Success: Focus outreach on high-LTV accounts with the highest recovery upside.

Leadership: Decide if recovery efforts justify hiring dedicated headcount (CSMs).

“The objective is to enable decision-making, not to maximize metric complexity.”

---

## 🚧 Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations: Churn is inferred from inactivity, not explicit cancellations. Revenue impact assumes uniform ARPU across tiers.

Next Steps: Validate churn thresholds with historical retention curves and incorporate "Cost of Intervention" to model net ROI.
